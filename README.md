## Technologies

## Developing

### Environment Variables
You'll need to create a `.env` file that contains the values for the **Django** secret keys, **The Blue Alliance** authentication key, as well as the port you want the webserver to listen on.
The `DJANGO_PORT` can be set to whatever you want, and the keys can be gotten from another code team member.
```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_KEY=<key>
TBA_AUTH=<key>
DJANGO_PORT=8000
```

### Makefile
```bash
make setup # clean old folders, install dependencies, migrate DB, and fetch TBA data
make run # run the server
```

Additional commands:
```bash
make scss # generate the SCSS files
make format # format Python code
make runserver # just run the Django server
make clean # clean up directories and files
make migrate # migrate database
make TBA # fetch TBA data
make admin # create admin user
```

### Manually
```bash
pip install pipenv # install pipenv

pipenv install # install dependencies
pipenv run python manage.py migrate # migrate DB
pipenv run python manage.py setupEvent # fetch data from TBA
pipenv run python manage.py createsuperuser # create Django admin superuser

pipenv run python manage.py runserver # run server
```

Alternatively, you can use `pipenv shell` to active the venv and run commands from inside of it
